## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers & Limitations

### 🤖 AI Model Limitations

**This tool uses AI models for security analysis. Please be aware of the following important limitations:**

#### **False Positives & False Negatives**
- ✅ **False Positives**: AI models may flag legitimate code as potentially malicious or vulnerable
- ❌ **False Negatives**: AI models may miss actual security vulnerabilities or malicious code
- 🔍 **Human Review Required**: Always have security experts review AI-generated findings

#### **Model-Specific Considerations**
- **Google Gemini**: May have different detection patterns and biases than other models
- **OpenAI GPT**: Training data cutoffs may affect detection of newer attack patterns
- **Anthropic Claude**: Different reasoning approaches may yield varying results
- **Model Updates**: AI model behavior can change with provider updates

#### **Context & Accuracy**
- 🎯 **Context Dependency**: AI analysis quality depends on the completeness of provided code context
- 📊 **Probabilistic Nature**: AI provides probability-based assessments, not definitive security guarantees
- 🔄 **Consistency**: Same code may receive different analysis results across multiple runs
- 🧠 **Training Limitations**: Models are limited by their training data and may not recognize novel attack vectors

### 🛡️ Security Analysis Scope

#### **What This Tool Analyzes**
- ✅ Static code analysis of GitHub Action files
- ✅ Common vulnerability patterns and suspicious code structures
- ✅ Potential security risks in workflow configurations
- ✅ Best practice violations and configuration issues

#### **What This Tool Does NOT Analyze**
- ❌ **Runtime Behavior**: Cannot detect runtime-only vulnerabilities
- ❌ **Dynamic Analysis**: No execution-time security testing
- ❌ **Network Security**: Limited analysis of network-based threats
- ❌ **Infrastructure Security**: Does not assess underlying infrastructure
- ❌ **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Does not perform deep dependency scanning

### 📋 Best Practices for Using AI Security Analysis

#### **Recommended Workflow**
1. **🔍 Use as Initial Screening**: Treat AI analysis as a first-pass security review
2. **👥 Human Verification**: Always have security professionals review flagged issues
3. **🔄 Multiple Models**: Consider using different AI providers for cross-validation
4. **📊 Trend Analysis**: Look for patterns across multiple scans rather than single results
5. **🛠️ Combine with Other Tools**: Integrate with traditional security scanning tools

#### **Risk Mitigation**
- **🚨 Critical Systems**: Never rely solely on AI analysis for critical security decisions
- **📝 Documentation**: Document all AI findings and human review decisions
- **🔄 Regular Updates**: Re-scan actions periodically as AI models improve
- **🎯 Targeted Review**: Focus human review on high-risk areas identified by AI
