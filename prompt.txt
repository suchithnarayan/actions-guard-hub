You are a security analyst reviewing source code. Analyze the source code of a GitHub Action to detect malicious code, and suspicious activities. The analysis should focus on identifying any intentional or unintentional security risks that could compromise the security of a GitHub repository or its workflows including but not limited to: unauthorized data access, suspicious network activity, code injection, privilege escalation, and any other potentially harmful behavior.

Your review should cover the following areas:

1. Review of the Entry Point (action.yml or action.yaml)
- Identify the main script or entry point (runs.using field).
    - Does it use node16, docker, or composite?
- Check for inputs and outputs:
    - Are there any default values that could lead to unexpected behavior?
    - Does it accept user-controlled input that may lead to command injection or path traversal?
2. Suspicious External Network Calls
- Look for any network requests (e.g., fetch(), axios, curl, wget, requests.get()).
    - Are requests made to untrusted or hardcoded external servers?
    - Does it leak repository secrets or data in outgoing requests?
    - Look for code if  it is performing malicious activities by sending environment variables to a remote server 
- Identify any webhooks, callbacks, or beaconing behavior.
3. Secrets and Credentials Exposure
- Look for direct use of process.env or os.environ to extract secrets.
- Identify if secrets are logged via console.log(), printf(), echo, etc.
- Check if secrets are passed as query parameters in URLs.
- Review how GITHUB_TOKEN is used:
    - Is it sent to external APIs?
    - Does it grant more permissions than necessary?
4. File System and Process Execution Risks
- Detect arbitrary command execution (exec, child_process.exec, subprocess.Popen, etc.).
    - Are inputs properly sanitized to prevent command injection?
- Look for unauthorized file access (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync, open(), os.remove()).
    - Is it accessing sensitive files like .ssh/, .git/, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow?
- Identify persistence mechanisms (e.g., modifying .bashrc, .profile, scheduled cron jobs).
5. Use of External Dependencies
- Identify dependencies used (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile).
- Check for:
    - Obfuscated or minified dependencies.
    - Dependencies that are outdated or vulnerable (check CVEs).
    - Usage of custom-built scripts from unknown sources.
6. Potential Supply Chain Attacks
- Look for signs of backdoored dependencies.
- Check if the action downloads or executes code from a third-party server dynamically.
- Identify use of self-extracting scripts that could introduce malicious payloads.
7. Privilege Escalation and Repository Takeover Risks
- Check if it writes to GITHUB_ENV or modifies environment variables in an unsafe way.
- Look for attempts to:
    - Modify .github/workflows/ dynamically.
    - Update branch protection rules.
    - Change repository settings via the GitHub API.
8. Code Obfuscation and Evasion Techniques
- Identify base64-encoded or encrypted payloads or strings that looks malicious.
- If Identified (any encoded or encrypted strings), try decode and analyse the string. 
- Look for signs of anti-analysis techniques (e.g., dynamically generated scripts, self-modifying code).
- Check for unexpected string manipulation or encoding (e.g., atob(), Buffer.from()).
9. Logging, Debugging, and Telemetry
- Review logs to see if they accidentally expose sensitive data.
- Check if debugging info is being sent to external monitoring services.
- Ensure error messages do not reveal repository structure, secrets, or credentials.
10. Post-Execution Cleanup and Persistence
- Check if the script cleans up files, logs, or history to hide its activity.
- Identify any persistent background processes that remain running after execution.
- Look for hidden self-replication mechanisms.

The final output should have (strictly follow this format) and the output should be in JSON (the content will be pushed to a json file. Make sure the structure is a corrrect json. This should be a mandatory check. If not retry. And do not have the ```json string or any other json markers)
Make sure the output does not loop and should not contain any other information other than the below mentioned format.
1. A detailed analysis for the above 10 areas and for each areas, mention if its (safe/unsafe) and a score (0 to 10, 0 is the least if its unsafe and 10 is the max if its safe). Take a call based on the issues identified by each area. 
2. Provide brief pointers for the security report covering these 5 fields as a JSON output (make sure the json response structure is valid and escapes and handles the double quotes. Validate the json format and structure to make sure the value does not have " which breaks the structure before giving the final response):
    1. "Security-Issues": Identified malicious code or suspicious code (if any).
    2. "Recommendations": Should this action be used (It can be used or it cant be used)? with a reason and if it is malicious or not.
    3. "mitigation-stratagy": Potential mitigation strategies for the identified issues.
    4. "risk-assessment": Overall security risk assessment.

Example output format: <Make sure to stick to this format mentioned in the example below>
Note: This is very important. The text given between <> are just the instructions. Do not print it in the output. Double check this!!!
